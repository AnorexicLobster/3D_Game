// AI USE AND REFERENCES

/*
 * Chat GPT was mainly used to help with the player/ evidence interaction.
 * I had the general structure down, but I was running into a lot of issues.
 * Mostly it restructured certain areas, and helped with debugging to help identify the issue.
 * 
 * AI was used in other areas to help with debugging, however, most of these other issues were caused within Unity itself,
 * so I ended up figuring out the solution myself.
 * 
 * Finally I used AI to help me identify ways of cleaning up the mesh and to explain these different things to me.
 * That was the extent of the AI use for this project.
